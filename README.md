# Unsupervised encoding selection and ensemble performance for biomedical classification

![image info](docs/images/overview.png)

Overview image illustrating the performance analyses of classifier ensembles on peptide encodings. An arbitrary number of encoded datasets can be processed (arrows). The workflow conducts preprocessing (a), ensemble pruning (b), training/testing (c), and processing of results (d) using a 100-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation. Manuscript submitted for publication.
